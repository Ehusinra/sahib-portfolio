# AI CONTRIBUTION RULES

You are working inside a professional Next.js (App Router) portfolio repository.

Rules:
- Do NOT change existing folder structure unless instructed
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Use Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles)
- Components must be reusable
- Follow clean architecture and accessibility best practices
- Prefer server components unless client is required
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- No unnecessary libraries
- Code must be production-ready

If unsure, ASK before changing structure.
