- Use Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles, no CSS modules)
- Prefer Server Components; use Client Components only when necessary
- Use Framer Motion for animations when appropriate
- Use Lucide Icons only

## Code Quality Rules
- Components must be reusable
- Keep components small and readable
- Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, aria labels)
- Optimize for performance and SEO
- Avoid premature optimization unless necessary

## Workflow Rules
- Explain architectural decisions briefly before coding
- If unsure about a decision, ASK before implementing
- Do not generate everything at once

This codebase represents a production-grade developer portfolio.
Quality and clarity matter more than speed.
